This data was gathered from the UCI Machine Learning study located here https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip . Only the activityname was not present in the original data, and was added as instructed.

##Study Design
Initially all values were extracted from the database. This was then narrowed by string searching each variable for "mean" or "std". Some measures, such as the frequency measures, are not direct measurements of the data, but are average measures of important secondary characteristics of the data. Due to their being valid, useful, and pertaining to the data, I have included them. The fbodybody... variables were not well documented, but appear to be direct measures of the data, so I have included those as well. The remainder fulfill the requirements.
